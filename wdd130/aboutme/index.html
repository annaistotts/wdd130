    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Anna. I am from Blackfoot, ID. I am majoring in Software Engineering with an emphasis
         in Web Development.</p>
    <p>I have been married for about 4 1/2 years to my best friend, Ethan! He is studying Electrical Engineering and graduates
         in two semesters. In our freetime, we love to play pickleball, golf, and tennis. Fun Fact: I served my mission in his home ward
         in San Diego. He was on a mission at the time in El Salvador, so I didn't meet him. I did serve around his family though and
         his mom set us up when we both got home! 
    </p>
    <p>I am so excited for this class and can't wait to get to know some of you better!</p>
